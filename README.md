https://datahub.io/machine-learning/mnist_784/r/mnist_784.csv
because dataset size is 122 Mb github don't give access to upload it to repository.

#TODO
- [ ] add callbacks to code
- [ ] add model architecture with a call back
- [ ] add mode architecture to README.md file
- [ ] run model with gpu and see the difference with cpu
